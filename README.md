## Duel-Feature

Main feature for a NodeJS project where multiple people can work through a series of problems. Link to the main repo where this feature is being built on.

Reason for a separate repo: Not extremely comfortable with AngularJS yet so I will build this feature on a completely different repo in order to get familiar with socket.io. One step at a time :)
